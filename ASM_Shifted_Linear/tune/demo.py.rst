Using line patches to solve the Mixed Poisson equation
=========================

.. rst-class:: emphasis
    In this demo, we demonstrate how to use :class:`~.ASMStarPC` to solve the mixed Poisson equation on an extruded mesh.
    The demo was contributed `Molin Han <mailto:molin.han20@imperial.ac.uk>`__

It is known that the condition number for the discretised Poisson problem will be unbounded in the small aspect ratio limit.
